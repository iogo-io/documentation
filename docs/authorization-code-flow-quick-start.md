# Authorization Code Flow Quick Start Tutorial

## Prerequisites

As a minimum prerequisite, you must [register](https://developer.iogo.io) you app (client) with [iogo](https://iogo.io):

- Fill in the app name.
- Select the app type.
  - For this flow, select **Web**.
- Add at least one redirect URL for your app.
  - Only HTTPS URLs are allowed.
  - At this point, you can add up to two redirect URLs per app.

## Steps

### Authorize the End-user

You will need to get the end-users authorization grant. This step may include:

- Redirecting the end-user to iogo to handle authorization;
- Obtaining the end-user's consent for the requested scope, unless consent has been previously given.

To authorize the end-user, your app must send the end-user to the authorization URL.

#### Example authorization URL

```
https://oidc.iogo.io/authorize?
    client_id=CLIENT_ID&
    redirect_uri=https://REDIRECT_URI/&
    response_type=code&
    scope=SCOPE&
    state=STATE
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `client_id`     | The app identifier issued during the registration process.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `redirect_uri`  | The app's redirection endpoint to which iogo redirects the end-user's browser when making the authorization request.                                                                                                                                 |
| `response_type` | The grant type. For this flow the value must be `code`.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `scope`         | The scope of the access request. The value is expressed as a list of space-delimited, case-sensitive strings. For this flow value must be `openid`, `email`, or `openid email`.                                                                      |
| `state`         | (Recommended) Opaque value used by the app to maintain state between the request and response. iogo includes this value when redirecting the browser back to the app. The parameter should be used for preventing cross-site request forgery (CSRF). |

#### Response

If the end-user grants you the access request, iogo will issue the authorization code and deliver it back to the client by appending the `code` parameter to the query component of the redirection URL.

```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://REDIRECT_URI/?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&state=STATE
```

### Request Tokens

The authorization code received from iogo must be exchanged for tokens:

```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://oidc.iogo.io/token \
  --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data client_id=CLIENT_ID \
  --data client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET \
  --data code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE \
  --data grant_type=authorization_code \
  --data redirect_uri=https://REDIRECT_URI/
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `client_id`     | The app identifier issued during the registration process and used for initiating the authorization request. |
| `client_secret` | The app secret issued during the registration process.                                                       |
| `code`          | The authorization code generated by iogo as a part of the authorization response.                            |
| `grant_type`    | The grant type. For this flow the value must be `authorization_code`.                                        |
| `redirect_uri`  | The app's redirection endpoint used for initiating the authorization request.                                |

#### Response

If the code exchange is successful, iogo will issue the access token and the ID token.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "access_token": ACCESS_TOKEN,
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "id_token": ID_TOKEN,
  "scope": SCOPE,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

`id_token` contains encoded end-user information; `access_token` is used for making requests to the `/userinfo` authentication API endpoint.

> ⚠️ **You should validate tokens before using them.
