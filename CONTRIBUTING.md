# Contributing to the Documentation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the documentation!

The following describes how to contribute to the documentation.

## Code of Conduct

We provide a Code of Conduct to make clear the behavior we expect from contributors and maintainers alike. We are committed to providing a welcoming and supportive environment and kindly request that you participate in these values as well.

Our Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.0, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0.

## Reporting Issues

If you have found a bug, spelling mistake, missing information, or anything related to the documentation that you feel is an issue that should be reported, please create a new issue here on GitHub.

An issue can be raised by clicking the _Issues_ tab at the top of the repository, followed by the _New issue_ button.

When submitting an issue, please thoroughly and concisely describe the problem you are experiencing so that we may easily understand and resolve the issue in a timely manner.

## Contributing Content

When contributing content to the documentation, please fork this repository first, and then edit the content of the document that you want to contribute to.

Please avoid submitting large pull requests containing contributions for multiple documents if the content is not interrelated. In this case, it is better to submit multiple smaller pull requests.

When adding new files the repository, we encourage you to make use of the existing content, often the quickest way to get started is to copy the structure of an existing file and remove irrelevant content. This will ensure consistency in styling amongst different documents.
